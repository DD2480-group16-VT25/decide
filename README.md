# Assignment 1 - Decide
This repository contains the code and documentation for **Assignment 1 - Decide** which is creating an Launch Interceptor Program.

## How to run it
Because of the nature of the program running it will not do anything so it is recommended to run the tests to check functionality of the program.
```
$ cd src
$ javac Decide.java
$ java Decide
```

## Group 16
We are group 16, and this assignment is part of the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals.

### Group Members
- Ellen Sigurðardóttir
- Linus Dinesjö
- Marcus Odin
- Robin Gunnarsson

## Statement of contributions
We devided the work by LICs. So each member is reponsible for their implementation and testing. We then set a deadline and after which everyone sat in a remote pair-programming session to stich everything together (to get "YES"/"NO" output) once the LIC-methods were done.

- Ellen Sigurðardóttir
  - Responsible for LIC4 - LIC7 including unit test. 
- Linus Dinesjö
  - Responsible for LIC8 - LIC11 including unit tests.
- Marcus Odin
  - Set up the code skeleton for main program and tests. Also did LIC0 and LIC12-14. Took part in group programming for the decide function and computations of CMV, PUM and FUV. 
- Robin Gunnarsson

## Testing
The tests use JUnit 4. So make  sure that is installed somewhere accessable before running tests.

## Way of working evaluation
We agree most with the description/checklist of **In Place**. We felt comfortable with the tools of Git and working in paralell to push to the same branch. We can't however relate to it being entirely *naturally* occuring as the "working well"-state suggests since we had to think actively about creating issues for each LIC-method etc.
