# Assignment 1 - Decide
This repository contains the code and documentation for **Assignment 1 - Decide** which is creating an Launch Interceptor Program.

## How to run it
**Use Java 17 or newer, make sure to use the encoding flag below if facing issues.**
The `Decide.java` main method rusn a trivial case and returns "YES" when ran. It is recommended to run the tests to check functionality of the program. Instructions for running the `Decide.java` main method is below.
```
$ javac -encoding UTF-8 src/main/Decide.java
$ java src.main.Decide
```

## Group 16
We are group 16, and this assignment is part of the course DD2480 Software Engineering Fundamentals.

### Group Members
- Ellen Sigurðardóttir
- Linus Dinesjö
- Marcus Odin
- Robin Gunnarsson

## Statement of contributions
We devided the work by LICs. So each member is reponsible for their implementation and testing. We then set a deadline and after which everyone sat in a remote pair-programming session to stich everything together (to get "YES"/"NO" output) once the LIC-methods were done.

- Ellen Sigurðardóttir
  - Responsible for LIC4 - LIC7 including unit test. 
- Linus Dinesjö
  - Responsible for LIC8 - LIC11 including unit tests.
- Marcus Odin
  - Set up the code skeleton for main program and tests. Also did LIC0 and LIC12-14. Took part in group programming for the decide function and computations of CMV, PUM and FUV. 
- Robin Gunnarsson
  - Responsible for LIC1 - LIC3 including unit tests.

## Testing
The tests use JUnit 4. So make  sure that is installed somewhere accessable before running tests.

## Way of working evaluation
We agree most with the description/checklist of **In Place**. We felt comfortable with the tools of Git and working in paralell to push to the same branch. We can't however relate to it being entirely *naturally* occuring as the "working well"-state suggests since we had to think actively about creating issues for each LIC-method etc.
